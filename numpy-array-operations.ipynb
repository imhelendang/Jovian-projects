    "> 1. Pick 5 interesting Numpy array functions by going through the documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.html \n",
    "> 2. Run and modify this Jupyter notebook to illustrate their usage (some explanation and 3 examples for each function). Use your imagination to come up with interesting and unique examples.\n",
    "> 3. Upload this notebook to your Jovian profile using `jovian.commit` and make a submission here: https://jovian.ml/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/assignment/assignment-2-numpy-array-operations\n",
    "> 4. (Optional) Share your notebook online (on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) and on the community forum thread: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/assignment-2-numpy-array-operations-share-your-work/10575 . \n",
    "> 5. (Optional) Check out the notebooks [shared by other participants](https://jovian.ml/forum/t/assignment-2-numpy-array-operations-share-your-work/10575) and give feedback & appreciation.\n",

It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",

    "- numpy.resize(a, new_shape)\n",

    "- numpy.promote_types(type1, type2) \n",
